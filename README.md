Project 4

SUMMARY ANALYSIS:
Based on the dataset - which focuses solely on factors such as age, gender, usage time, platform, and the number of comments, likes and posts of each person, not factors like mental health history - it can be concluded that happiness, anxiety, anger and sadness are the dominant emotions people feel when visiting social media platforms. Not surprisingly, the more likes a person received, the greater the level of happiness; however, anxiety was also assiated with a greater number of likes, implying social anxiety or perhaps anxiety enducing topics. In terms of comments, happiness was still the dominant emotion when it came to a greater number of comments, with anger as a relatively close second. This would make sense considering that the dataset doesn't indicate whether a comment was positive, negative or neutral, so the comments could fuel anger and anxiety in addition to happiness. It should be noted that boredom was lower when more likes and comments were received, but higher as related to the amount of time spent on social media. 

Of particular interest is the breakdown of dominant emotions by platform. This data was quite telling (and not surprising) when the purpose and primary audience of each platform is taken into account. Instagram, is more for pictures and fun videos, so people reported happiness more frequently than other emotions, and at a much higher rate than other platforms. To the contrary, Twitter (now X) invoked anger as the dominant emotion, with sadness as a distant second. Twitter is often filled with political arguments, so it's not surprising that anger was reported as the dominant emotion when using this platform. Then there is LinkedIn, which is interesting and useful, but it's not as exciting - especially for younger users - so boredom was the most common emotion reported for that site. Meanwhile, Facebook users reported feeling emotionally "neutral" as their dominant emotion. Using the RandomForestClassifier, we can predict the dominant emotion with very high accuracy based on the data provided.   

LIMITATIONS:
As previously stated, the limitations of this data are important to keep in mind, as this is a snapshot of emotions based on relatively surface level variables. Mental health history is vital to understanding this data with more complexity.
